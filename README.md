# The Monster Game

This monster game was built on macOS, but should work with Windows, and Linux too.

System Requirements: Node v11.11.0+

## Quick Start

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then follow the instructions in your terminal. Watch out, there are monsters about! ðŸ‘¾

### Assumptions

-   City names don't contain any whitespace characters
-   Each monster will move once per round and they move synchronously one after the other
-   Readability over brevity is preferred
-   TypeScript is allowed
