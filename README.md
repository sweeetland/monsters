# The Monster Game

This monster game was built on macOS, but should work with Windows, and Linux too.

System Requirements: Node v11.11.0+

## Quick Start

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

If something doesn't work try...

```sh
npm run refresh
npm start
```

Then follow the instructions in your terminal. Watch out, there are monsters about! 👾

### Assumptions

- City names don't contain any whitespace characters
- Each monster will move once per round and they move synchronously one after the other
- On start there is only one monster per city so max number of monsters is dependant number of starting cities
- Readability over brevity
- TypeScript is allowed 🚀
